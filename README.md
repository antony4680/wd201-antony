<br>Course outcomes are :
<li>Build web applications using Rails.
<li>Manipulate data using both imperative and functional programming techniques.
<li>Model real-world systems using object-oriented design.
<li>Write HTML & CSS to create elegant web pages.
<li>Build complex applications that interact with the database using ActiveRecord.

<h3> Overview </h3>
<p>Through the course, you will work up to build a Todo Management application using Rails, 
   PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS. The app will be hosted on the cloud using Heroku.</p>

<p>You will then independently build an online ordering and point-of-sale system similar to Swiggy
  as their capstone project. It will be a microcosm of a production web application and the challenges
  and trade-offs that comes with it.</p>
